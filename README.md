# Assignment #7 - Taste Tracker

## Goals for the App:
- [x] Create arrays to store food data
- [x] Loop through and log specific outputs
- [x] Write and call a function using a parameter
- [x] Use conditionals to filter items
- [x] Compare array lengths and find specific values

## Issues I found along the way:
1. "// 5. Print out only foods that have an "a" in the name. For example, "Pizza" would not be included, but "Pasta" would be."

2. Question #10 didn't ask for a check whether longFoodNames == shortFoodNames. Included it.

3. Spring Rolls and Clam Chwoder both have length of 12. This is an issue when evaluating which is longest.

## Reflection:
> Focusing hard on C++ this Summer and Fall has really paid dividends for things like this.
> JavaScript seems like C++'s easier and more intuitive cousin!
